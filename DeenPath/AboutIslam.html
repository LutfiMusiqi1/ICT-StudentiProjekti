      <h1>About Islam</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Islam</strong>
        <span class="collapsible-content">
          is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion founded on submission to the will of Allah (God). It is the second-largest religion in the world, with over a billion followers. The word "Islam" itself means "submission" and is derived from the same root as "peace" in Arabic, reflecting the faith's emphasis on finding peace through submission to God.

      <h2>Brief History of Islam</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>History:</strong>
        <span class="collapsible-content">
          Islam began in the 7th century CE in the cities of Mecca and Medina in Arabia. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ received the first revelation at the age of 40. Facing early opposition in Mecca, he and his followers migrated to Medina (the Hijrah), marking the start of the Islamic calendar. After the Prophet’s passing, Islam spread rapidly across Asia, Africa, and Europe during the Caliphate era.
